As run_ppdisk_analytic_2, but now with two grain sizes: One small grain size
population, which is distributed vertically in the same way as the gas. The
other a big grain population, which is settled very close to the midplane.
To ensure that both dust populations are spatially well resolved, the vertical
grid (or better: the theta-grid) is refined near the midplane. The procedure
of refinement is the same as used for the inner edge (see run_ppdisk_simple_3),
but here applied to theta. Run the plot_structure.py script to see how the
refinement is done.
