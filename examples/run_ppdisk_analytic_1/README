The run_ppdisk_analytic_* series of models represents a bit more self-consistent
series of models. Here the vertical structure is computed from a radial midplane
temperature profile that is computed from a simple analytic flaring disk model
of the kind similar to Chiang & Goldreich (1997). The hydrostatic structure is
not fully self-consistent, as the temperature used for the computation of
the vertical scale height of the gas (and the dust) is the analytic one, not
the one resulting from RADMC-3D's thermal Monte Carlo. In principle you could
iterate the procedure: use the resulting midplane temperature and re-compute
the vertical scale height (the array hp in problem_setup.py) from those values.
But this procedure can lead to strange effects near the inner edge. So use it
with care.

The normal model setup is like this:

   python problem_setup.py
   radmc3d mctherm

You can speed it up by running RADMC-3D in parallel with

   radmc3d mctherm setthreads 4

(using 4 OpenMP threads).

If you want to check the density and temperature structure:

   ipython --matplotlib
   %run plot_structure.py

This gives four plots showing the structure of the model. With

   %run plot_opacity.py

You can see what the opacity model looks like. With

   %run plot_images.py

you get two plots showing images at 1300 micron and 1 micron.
And finally, with

   %run plot_spectra.py

(takes a while) you can view the SED of the model.
