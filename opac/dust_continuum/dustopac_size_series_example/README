Here is an example of how to make a series of dust opacities of different sizes.
It is just meant as an example, and you may need to modify it to your needs.

Here is what you should do:

  make
  python problem_make_all_opacities.py

This creates the opacity files for a series of grain sizes. The sizes themselves
are listed in the file sizes.inp, and the grain species and material density is
written to the file dustproperties.inp

Then to make some nice plots:

  ipython --matplotlib
  %run plot_all_opacities.py

To clean everything up:

A few caveats:

 - So far only the full dustkapscatmat_*.inp files are generated, not the
   smaller dustkappa_*.inp files.

 - The large grains have very large errors in the normalization, hence the
   very large error tolerance used. This is, however, due to the fact that
   at short wavelength for large grains the scattering is very strongly
   forward-peaked, which can not be handled with the 181-point angular
   sampling. However, very-forward-peaked scattering is almost like no
   scattering (after all: the photon continues on almost the same path).
   So we use the "chopping" method to limit the forward scattering.

 - For VERY large grains, the Mie calculation becomes very slow. At a
   later point it is planned to replace the shortest-wavelength values
   for such very large grains with an approximation.
